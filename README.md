# Flux kernel
## Flux kernel is an amateur project created by me, it is a kernel with basic functions and is not suitable for everyday use
## Flux Kernel motto - do it yourself
#### This means that the basic version of the kernel works as a template that you can use to create your own operating system. The code is fully described by me, although it has gaps in the code that you have to program yourself, it still simplifies the work a lot.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Supported features:
#### - CD command - change the working directory
#### - ls command - used to list files
#### - help command - list available commands
#### - cat command - reads each File parameter in sequence and writes it to standard output
#### - VGA support
#### - Simple keyboard driver

###### The project will be developed in the future :)
